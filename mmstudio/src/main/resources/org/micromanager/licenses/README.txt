This directory contains license and copyright information for components
that the distributed program depends on (and thus we have to prove that we
have permission to distribute said components). The files in this directory
are examined by the LicenseDialog class in the Java UI; their names are
used to construct a "table of contents". As this table is alphabetically
sorted, spaces are used to force certain entries to the start of the list.
